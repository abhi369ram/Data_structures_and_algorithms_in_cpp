//    There is a well-known city (which will go nameless here) whose inhabi- tants have the
//    reputation of enjoying a meal only if that meal is the best they have ever experienced in their life.
//    Otherwise, they hate it. Assum- ing meal quality is distributed uniformly across a personâ€™s life
//    , what is the expected number of times inhabitants of this city are happy with their meals?
